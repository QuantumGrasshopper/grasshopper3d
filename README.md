# Simulation of the Grasshopper Problem in 3d Euclidean space

Currently implemented for a cubic grid and with simulated annealing

1. Prerequisites and compilation

- make
- GSL library
- g++ compiler with c++17 (or another C++ compiler, which requires adjusting the Makefile)

To compile the code, type `make` in the shell while in the folder containing the code.

2. Code options (the order doesn't matter)

| option          | comment |
| --------------- | ------------------ |
| `-d`           | hopping distance of the grasshopper in regular length units (the length unit in which the volume is 1), e.g. 0.1 or 0.5 or 2 or 10 |
| `-hours`       | how many hours the code should run (can be less than 1 hour), e.g. 0.1, 0.5, 2, 48, can also be 0 (default value) if you only want to look at the initial configuration |
| `-steps`       |    how many steps the code should maximally run (`1e12` by default), but code will terminate earlier if maximal time is reached |
| `-N`           | total number of grid points with spin 1 (10000 is default) |
| `-initconf`    | how to initialise the system, must be specified. Currently implemented: `random` or `load` (load configuration from file called `initconf.dat`) |
| `-tempsteps`   | initial number of steps before first temperature decrease (the number of steps between decreases goes up with each round) |
| `-inittemp`    | initial temperature |
| `-fintemp`     | final temperature (need to run long enough to reach it) |
| `-annealsteps` | number of simulated annealing steps between initial and final temperature |
| `-gridsize`    | for square grid length of square edge (number of cells) |
| `-randomseed`  | initial value for the random number generator |

You can also look into the source code to remind yourself of what the options do.

The code will generate the following output files:

file name | comment
---------- | ---------
`result.dat` | general info about the simulation and parameters
`initconf.dat` | initial spin configuration
`finconf.dat` | final spin configuration
`energies.dat` | every time the energy changes the energy value is written to this file
`config.dat` | stores the spin configuration and energy every certain number of steps, can be used to generate animations of the system evolution
`temperatures.dat` | every annealing round prints the counter, the current temperature, and the current acceptance ratio
`bestconf.dat` | best configuration over the whole run

Example of command to run the code:

> `./grasshopper -N 10000 -initconf random -gridsize 50 -d 0.3 -hours 1 -inittemp 20.0 -fintemp 0.05 `

Not all options need to be always specified, but specifying `N`, `d` and `hours` is a good idea. Also `initconf` needs to be specified.

3. Plotting spin configurations

The included Python script `config_plot.py` plots a grasshopper spin configuration in 3d, such as `initconf.dat` or `bestconf.dat` etc. Inputs are the name of the configuration file and the size of the grid.
